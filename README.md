The Foundry is a collection of content generators and automation programs made by and for use by Aiden Roskelley. 
It's a unique product to me because for one, I've never made them before. And for two, they are being made for exclusively my own personal use.

Anyone else reading this, feel free to browse and look inside. Whether there's one program right now or a hundred, this is an ever-changing project so it's never truly get boring.
Have a good day, and enjoy theFoundry.
